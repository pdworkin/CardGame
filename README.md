# CardGame
This is a weekend hack that explored how far I could go with a data structure for a deck of cards.  It ended up as a game among n computer players with a simple AI and with the agents able to connect in via remote sockets.  There's a simple GUI that monitors the play and keeps track of score.

This was mostly to show that I could handle a project with Swing and networks.  I will getting around to clening it up and switching it to a MVC model.
